# War-Game
War Game was my final project in the course "Programming Video Games and Special Effects"  at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE) in Skopje, Macedonia. This project is made in Unity3D, and the game is a mix of 3D graphics and models into 2D space.

War Game is a specific 2D arcade game, with 3D elements. It may look like ordinary game, but the models are 3D and they are placed and moved in 3D space. With that, the game has a specific depth of the environment. For the camera, a prespective view to point the depth (z-dimension), althrough during the game two axis are used (x and y).

During the game, you are in control of a plane that has a mission to destroy all incomming enemy planes, also destroying the main boss in the end. The arsenal of weapons in which you are in control are limited, firing ordinary bullets that that do little damage, rockets that are very powerful and they can destroy the incoming planes with single shot. Also there are ground weapons for incoming vhiecles. The munition is limitless.

**Main missions** is to destroy 50 enemy planes so you can fight the main boss.

You will notice that the planes at the begining don't shot at  you. Yes, the can't use weapons, but the main boss - he doesn't stop shooting at your position. The planes altrough they don't shoot, they have different energy and are moving with different speed. It is logical smaller planes to move faster, and huge planes to move slowly. During the distruction of a planes, a explossion is shown following with a sound.
