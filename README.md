# War-Game
War Game was my final project in the course "Programming Video Games and Special Effects"  at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE) in Skopje, Macedonia. This project is made in Unity3D, and the game is a mix of 3D graphics and models into 2D space.

War Game is a specific 2D arcade game, with 3D elements. It may look like ordinary game, but the models are 3D and they are placed and moved in 3D space. With that, the game has a specific depth of the environment. For the camera, a prespective view to point the depth (z-dimension), althrough during the game two axis are used (x and y).
