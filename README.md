# War-Game
War Game was my final project in the course "Programming Video Games and Special Effects"  at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE) in Skopje, Macedonia. This project is made in Unity3D, and the game is a mix of 3D graphics and models into 2D space.

War Game is a specific 2D arcade game, with 3D elements. It may look like ordinary game, but the models are 3D and they are placed and moved in 3D space. With that, the game has a specific depth of the environment. For the camera, a prespective view to point the depth (z-dimension), althrough during the game two axis are used (x and y).

During the game, you are in control of a plane that has a mission to destroy all incomming enemy planes, also destroying the main boss in the end. The arsenal of weapons in which you are in control are limited, firing ordinary bullets that that do little damage, rockets that are very powerful and they can destroy the incoming planes with single shot. Also there are ground weapons for incoming vhiecles. The munition is limitless.

**Main missions** is to destroy 50 enemy planes so you can fight the main boss.

You will notice that the planes at the begining don't shot at  you. Yes, the can't use weapons, but the main boss - he doesn't stop shooting at your position. The planes altrough they don't shoot, they have different energy and are moving with different speed. It is logical smaller planes to move faster, and huge planes to move slowly. During the distruction of a planes, a explossion is shown following with a sound.

Maybe they can not shoot at you, but they are still dangerous. Be careful not to crash with them. The planes are generated by random choice and are imported in the game. After they left the view port of the camera they are destroyed. The same goes with the player weapons.

The area is specific and gives the effect like the players is flying forward, but in fact a trick is used in which the background is moving and the player stay in one place. This method is used in many holywoods movies. To be more realistic, the background is divided in couple of layers.

You will notice couple of layers. The first is the closest to the camera and it is moving very fast. This layer is represented by the small buildings in front. The middle layer is represented with tall buildings and it is moving slowly. And the last layer is presenting the sky, it is far away from the camera and it is moving very slowly. When you combine this three layers, you get an experience like you are flying very fast and in the background you can see the city.

To have a very rich environment, bacground noces are used and planes which do a fly-by. This planes cover the space in the z-axis. They can fly alone, or in a formations. This planes are also randomly chosen and imported in da game, also they are destroyed when they live the viewport of the camera.

To pint out the 3D effect in 2D environment, you can notice with the player plane. When the player fly up or down, the plane is rotated. And when we stop the playing is going back in the original position. With this movement, the plain is moving smooth and realistic in eight directions, not like in a matrix.

Also important effect is the missile launch. If you look careful you can notice that when you launch two rockets, alwys the first is over the other. That is because alternately misslie launch. Between the rockets there is a small space, because the rockets are launch from the player plane wings. This is a 3D launching but in 2D environment.

Same goes for the main boss weapons.
